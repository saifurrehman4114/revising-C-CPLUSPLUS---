     loops and nested loops 
     
     for  run till a range. inialization in it seprate with comma  i = 0 for(;i<3;i++) stepping condiotn can be inside for body stepping and testing condition for(:++i<3;) infinite loop for(;;) if u want to terminate hen cod ein body the decision for(::) if(getch()=="/r") break;
     
     for(int i=0: i<=5; i++); null loop 6 answer it will increase just th ecounter when condition would be false it will go to next line 
     while conditon can be complex with relational and logic operators amd infinite loop. if we use while(i<10);  infinite loop increment an ddecrement in conidiotn  while(++i<=10) if inside condiotion 1 itis true can terminte with decision other than variable.

     functions does some specific task user defined or built in function lib,
     
     (Arthimethic ,data conversion,character clasifciation string manipulation,searching, sorting, I/O, file handling, directory control, bufer ,disk i/O, memory allocation process,
     graphic date/time,dos and miscellaneous)
     -signature / prototype 
     main-maindefinition 
     - call function formal( local var in function scope )and acutual arguments and parameters( data type, sequecne and no) input main->function  output main<-return 
     -return or nothing void type 
     
     no input in then use void in protype parameter list
     
     function type,function name,sequence, data type, no of parameter then compiler exutes function
     
     first protype then call then defintion 
     
     if no return type in protype it is int  
     
     call by variable or call by constant function saif (s,s)
     - by value 
     - by ref
     
     
     Data Str Linear connection and sequence and non linear no connection and no sequecne 
     
     linear connection continuius and others are pointer like links 
     
     Arrays finite elements and homogenous data elemets
     data type name or identifier [ no of value orvariables ]
     int saif[10]; or we have array of objects
      array starts from 0
      indivual element access a[4] 
      array index or subscript inside th ebrackets  gives us the elemnt or reference of the array elemnt
      
      initialization 
      int a[4] = {0,1,2,3};
      
      if not knw the elemts then int a[] = {1,2,3,4}
       
       if no intilization garbage value inside element some value initilaize then oters would have zero a[4] = {1,1}
       
       decide range there is no bound checking in C/C++ ILLEGAL RESULT OR COMPUTER WILL HANG OT IN IF U TAKE VALUE TILl 40 u wanted till 4 in a loop 
       
       passsign a array element to function 
       
       int test[2]

       int saif[5][4]; //rows 5 and cols 4 total elemts 5*4
       
       total elements less than 1 would be last element location in that index
       linear or 1 dimensional array 2 dimsional array initialization 
        saif[2][3] = {{1,3,4},{5,8,7}} // how many rows that much {}pairs and elemts inside equal to col

     structure diff memory loc for data fields, members are public. data field have doff data type coll of hetetrogenous elemrnts 
     temporary no space allocated untill variable created try to create ot at top of ile or imort from header file. new data type u create. assingn data use . operato=
     struct saif optional tag name {
      fied 1; field2;
      :

     intiliation saif={1, "Saif"};
     
     diff strucutres can have same name field compiler knows to deal
     members are store in contiguous locations 
     
     you can pass stucture to function as normal variable 
     
     saif = test it will tranfer data of test strucutre to saif if both have same data tpe strucutre 
     
     nested struture nested struture is used as a member complex data type orDMBS programs usage.
     
     stru unit {
     
     int feet;
     float inches;
     };
     
     strut measure {
     
     unit length;
     unit width;
     };
     
     Measure M1; M1.length.feet = 5, M1.length.inches = 5; M1.width.feet = 5 M1.width.feet = 5  how much nesting that much dots operator 
     
     
     union diff data types one location for data. if you update value it will overwrite. one datatype at one one time. Bigger datatyoe will overwrite.MAX VYTE DATATYPEPLACE.Want to use one field than unio useage. ROM Bios programming. NEsted unions. Diff datatypes treated with one memoery loc. Union variable.
      Java donot have Unions and Structure.

     pointers 
     
     pointer type of the address u want to store and * of the pointer sign name of pointer
     get address of variable "& operator"  and * to get value of the variable address store in pointer

     //OOP 
     
     Class template composes of properties and methods acess modifiers private ,protected, public for properties and methods. members are private. Nested classes usage when we want to use classese both inside na dmake one isntance. 
     object instance of class. Object have objective characteristics and name object = private data + public functions 
      Active and passive channels and communication channel
      priavte by default data private then fucntions public
      
      u can call members in three places main,child ,object class inside 
      
      levels| within class | from inherit | main
      
      private |yes|no|no
      protected|yes|yes|no
      public|yes|yes|yes
      
      Main program public - protected inherit class -protected  priavted class 
      
      Struture prog AND oop data type - Class ADT varible -instance object ,fucntion/rocedure/method members services,function calls/message passing 
      sizeof() return bytes of object size in memory.
      
      desructor destroys object when program finishes it calls itself it has no return type  member of class when object finishes name of the class  
     FREES the memeory  
      ~SAIF (){
      
      cout<<"destroted object";
      }
      
      Constructor calss automatically when an object is madeit is used to make assign values to data of class or intilizae data  
      no return type
      classname(parameter list ){
      
      }
      
      Constructor overloading  just parameter would be different default parameter 
      default copy constructor copy one construcor values of object  to other object we give  constructor  the  obejct two ways to call default = and operator and parathesis    
        Test t1(5,0)
        test t2(t1);
        test t3 = t1;
        
        we can give objects as parameters and return them to from fucntions and call them through third object and you can access there data to 
        :: RESOLUTION operator THIS keyword and NEW keyword  (. Dot operator access object memebrs ) with Arrow Operator (->) you can point to properties of class and functions with reference type pointer    
       we can define function outside the classmany object will have one function prgram and memory optimization whe u use loops use in function outside of class in class function comiler does not allow progrma gets comoplex  otherwise in the class u just give definition
