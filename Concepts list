    decisions 
    
     if else elseif switch( diif cases check diff outpt input can be int or char case matches case value cahr or int if no break all cases would be excuted or untill break come sin and default value like else  ) decision tree read from right left  
     zero false +veor -ve would be true

     loops and nested loops 
     
     for  run till a range. inialization in it seprate with comma  i = 0 for(;i<3;i++) stepping condiotn can be inside for body stepping and testing condition for(:++i<3;) infinite loop for(;;) if u want to terminate hen cod ein body the decision for(::) if(getch()=="/r") break;
     
     for(int i=0: i<=5; i++); null loop 6 answer it will increase just th ecounter when condition would be false it will go to next line 
     while conditon can be complex with relational and logic operators amd infinite loop. if we use while(i<10);  infinite loop increment an ddecrement in conidiotn  while(++i<=10) if inside condiotion 1 itis true can terminte with decision other than variable.

     -signature / prototype 
     main-maindefinition 
     - call function formal( local var in function scope )and acutual arguments and parameters( data type, sequecne and no) input main->function  output main<-return 
     -return or nothing void type 
     
     no input in then use void in protype parameter list
     
     function type,function name,sequence, data type, no of parameter then compiler exutes function
     
     first protype then call then defintion 
     
     if no return type in protype it is int

     structure diff memory loc for data fields, members are public. data field have doff data type coll of hetetrogenous elemrnts 
     temporary no space allocated untill variable created try to create ot at top of ile or imort from header file. new data type u create. assingn data use . operato=
     struct saif optional tag name {
      fied 1; field2;
      :

     };

     intiliation saif={1, "Saif"};
     
     diff strucutres can have same name field compiler knows to deal
     members are store in contiguous locations 
     
     you can pass stucture to function as normal variable 
     
     saif = test it will tranfer data of test strucutre to saif if both have same data tpe strucutre 
     
     nested struture nested struture is used as a member complex data type orDMBS programs usage.
     
     stru unit {
     
     int feet;
     float inches;
     };
     
     strut measure {
     
     unit length;
     unit width;
     };
     
     Measure M1; M1.length.feet = 5, M1.length.inches = 5; M1.width.feet = 5 M1.width.feet = 5  how much nesting that much dots operator 
     
     
     union diff data types one location for data. if you update value it will overwrite. one datatype at one one time. Bigger datatyoe will overwrite.MAX VYTE DATATYPEPLACE.Want to use one field than unio useage. ROM Bios programming. NEsted unions. Diff datatypes treated with one memoery loc. Union variable.
      Java donot have Unions and Structure.

     pointers 
     
     pointer type of the address u want to store and * of the pointer sign name of pointer
     get address of variable "& operator"  and * to get value of the variable address store in pointer 
     
     pointers operators *p++ *(p++)
     
     & reference operator * deference get address and get value
